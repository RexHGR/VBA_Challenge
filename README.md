# VBA_Challenge
Repository for Module 2 Challenge Activity
Overview of project
**Purpose**  

Validate and practice VBA scripting in order to display information with a minimal level of search, by scripting functions around specifica ranges and criteria we can recall and simplify information that would be unaccesible or even could supose an elevated amount of time to find or substract.

By using Microsoft Excel VBA we can automate tasks while learning and providing a full insight into programing environment for Data Analysis.

Excel VBA  allows us to explore fundamental programming concepts of commands, variables, decisions, repetition, objects, and events while one can explore several iteration to reach the desired objective, i,e : information, result or search.

**Analysis and Challenges**


**Use your knowledge of VBA and the starter code provided in this Challenge to refactor the Module2_VBA_Script so you loop through the data one time and collect all of the information. Your refactored code should run faster than it did in this module.**
