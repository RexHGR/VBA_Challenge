Overview of project
**Purpose**  

Validate and practice VBA scripting in order to display information with a minimal level of search, by scripting functions around specifica ranges and criteria we can recall and simplify information that would be unaccesible or even could supose an elevated amount of time to find or substract.

By using Microsoft Excel VBA we can automate tasks while learning and providing a full insight into programing environment for Data Analysis.

Excel VBA  allows us to explore fundamental programming concepts of commands, variables, decisions, repetition, objects, and events while one can explore several iteration to reach the desired objective, i,e : information, result or search.

**Challenges and dificulties**

Although most of the code was learned from modules, syntax and refactoring prove a challenge in which a diferent approach or elaboration on how to display or name variables, recall ranges and cells and understanding the theory on placing or choosing with code rather than selecting info straight from worksheet.

**Results**

Although certain criteria was not met when writing code i was able to verify and refactor with the help of authors and aditional reading to complement and comply.
